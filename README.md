tools for creating and modifying digital images, a digital artists sketchbook

things i'm working on are in half-baked/
i'm trying to make tools that produce art that's nice to look at
the kinds of things you'd want to hang on your wall
either art based on real pictures or just things that look nice
some of these tools take images in and modify them or in some way give output based on them
some of these just make pictures from scratch
many are based on mathematical ideas and/or randomness
hopefully they all use nice colors
